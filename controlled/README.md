All patches that are created especially for the use with a controller.  
This could be:
*  simple MIDI keyboard
*  specific MIDI controller (i.e. MPD or Launch Control)
*  joystick/gamepad
*  Leap Motion (Geco MIDI mapped)
*  MPE compatible MIDI controller  

If patch was created for something else than a simple MIDI keyboard its name will indicated that.
